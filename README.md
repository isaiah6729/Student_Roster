# Student_Roster

COMPETENCIES

The graduate applies fundamental programming concepts in a specific programming environment.

The graduate prepares code which declares, initializes, and assigns values to variables of appropriate types as part of the application development process.

The graduate writes code that implements decision and loop constructs to control the flow of a program.

The graduate creates arrays in order to solve complex problems.

The graduate applies pointers to solve complex problems.

The graduate writes code that creates and manipulates functions and files.

The graduate applies object-oriented programming concepts in order to create a basic application.

INTRODUCTION

In this assessment, you will create a C++ application based on the scenario below. You must use either Visual Studio or Xcode for this assessment. 

SCENARIO

You are hired as a contractor to help a university migrate an existing student system to a new platform using C++ language. Since the application already exists, its requirements exist as well. This part of the system is responsible for reading and manipulating the provided data.

You must write a program containing two classes (i.e., Student and Roster). The program will maintain a current roster of students within a given course. Student data for the program include student ID, first name, last name, email address, age, an array of the number of days to complete each course, and degree program. This information can be found in the “studentData Table” below. The program will read a list of five students and use function calls to manipulate data (see part F4 in the requirements below). While parsing the list of data, the program should create student objects. The entire student list will be stored in one array of students called classRosterArray. Specific data-related output will be directed to the console.

 

You may not include third-party libraries. Your submission should include one zip file with all the necessary code files to compile, support, and run your application. You must also provide evidence of the program’s required functionality by taking a screen capture of the console run, saved as an image file.
